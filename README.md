 42 Project - GET_NEXT_LINE
</h1>


## Overview

GET_NEXT_LINE is a simple function developed as part of the curriculum at 42 School. The function reads a line from a file descriptor, allowing for dynamic reading of text from files or standard input (stdin).

## Features

- **Dynamic Line Reading:** Implements a function that reads a line from a file descriptor and returns it without the newline character.
- **Buffer Management:** Manages buffers efficiently to handle reading lines of varying lengths.
- **File Descriptor Support:** Supports reading from any valid file descriptor, including standard input (stdin).
- **Bonus Features:** For those looking to extend the functionality, bonus features include developing get_next_line() using only one static variable and managing multiple file descriptors simultaneously.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ychbily/GET_NEXT_LINE.git
```
2. Include the get_next_line.h in your project:
```bash
#include "get_next_line.h"
```
3. Call the get_next_line function in your code to read lines from file descriptors.
